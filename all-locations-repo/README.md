## Task description

In our real Tymeshift frontend application we **have an "All locations" page** where we display all the locations where company users are located.
This task is designed to be **a simple version of a real page we use** and to give you a feeling of what your job will look like in Tymeshift.
On the other hand we will be able to check how you handle a real requirement.

**_This is the simplified "All locations" page:_**

**Implement small react application:**

1. It will display "All locations" page.
2. Clicking on a specific location should display a modal.
3. The modal will display all the properties of that single location.
4. Modal should be closable.

5. Locations on main "All locations" page are displayed with a card showing some of the location properties.
6. Every location card should also contain a section "Views:",
7. The "Views:" section will display the real number next to it & default starting value is 0.
8. Every time the user clicks on a location to display its properties, number of views should increase by 1.
